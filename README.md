2. Drag and drop xcframework file to your project

### Setup

1. **Delegate Implementation:**  
   Conform to `BambuserVideoPlayerDelegate` in your class to handle player events and errors.

2. **Initialize the Video Player:**  
   Create an instance of `BambuserVideoPlayer` with your `OrganizationServer` configuration.

3. **Create a Player View:**  
   Generate a player view using the `createPlayerView(videoConfiguration:ignoredSafeAreaEdges:)` method and embed it into your appâ€™s UI.

```swift
// Example Usage
let organizationServer = OrganizationServer(/* Your configuration */)
let videoPlayer = BambuserVideoPlayer(server: organizationServer)
let videoConfiguration = BambuserVideoConfiguration(/* Your configuration */)
let playerView = videoPlayer.createPlayerView(videoConfiguration: videoConfiguration)
